I'm a software engineer based in Vienna, Austria. I hold a BSc in Software & Information Engineering from the TU Vienna. 
Professionally I spend my time as a java framework developer, in my free time I like to tinker with iOS and game development.

(Of course I also enjoy unrelated nerd things such a gaming or being active)
